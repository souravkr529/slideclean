## Detailed Description

Zenly SlideClean is a specialized watermark removal tool designed primarily for Google NotebookLM slides. When users export slides from NotebookLM, they often contain watermarks that need to be removed for professional presentations or sharing.

Unlike cloud-based watermark removers, Zenly SlideClean processes files entirely within the user's browser using JavaScript and WebAssembly. This means:
- Files are never uploaded to any server
- Processing works offline after initial page load
- User privacy is completely protected
- No file size limits since there's no upload

## Technical Implementation

The watermark removal uses a "pixel cloning" algorithm:
1. Identifies the watermark location (bottom-right corner for NotebookLM)
2. Samples pixels from an adjacent clean area
3. Blends the sampled pixels over the watermark using feathering
4. Preserves the rest of the image/slide untouched

### Supported Formats
- **Input:** PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG
- **Output:** PDF (for PDF input), PNG (for image input)

### Libraries Used
- pdf.js (Mozilla) - PDF parsing and rendering
- jsPDF - PDF generation
- Native Canvas API - Image manipulation

## Target Users

1. Students using Google NotebookLM for study materials
2. Educators creating presentation slides
3. Professionals cleaning up exported slides
4. Anyone needing to remove watermarks from images

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Privacy First:** Unlike Canva, Remove.bg, or other cloud tools - no file uploads
2. **Truly Free:** No "free tier" limitations or upsells
3. **Offline Work:** Functions without internet after loading
4. **NotebookLM Optimized:** Specifically tuned for NotebookLM watermark patterns
